Scimax is an Emacs starterkit designed for people interested in reproducible research and publishing. Scimax is just Emacs that has been configured extensively to make it act like we need it to for research documentation and publication. The notes below document some features we have built into scimax.

* Org-mode
scimax provides a lot of customization of org-mode. 

** Markup shortcuts
scimax defines some shortcuts for org-mode markup. You can select text and type the shortcut to wrap the region in the markup, or if on a word, type the shortcut to wrap the word, or type the short cut to create the markup with the cursor inside it to keep typing.

| markup            | keyshortcut | emacs-command                       |
|-------------------+-------------+-------------------------------------|
| *Bold*            | s-b         | `org-bold-region-or-point'          |
| /italics/         | s-i         | `org-italics-region-or-point'       |
| =verbatim=        | s-v         | `org-verbatim-region-or-point'      |
| ~code~            | s-c         | `org-code-region-or-point'          |
| _underline_       | s-u         | `org-underline-region-or-point'     |
| +strike+          | s-+         | `org-strikethrough-region-or-point' |
| _{subscript}      | s--         | `org-subscript-region-or-point'     |
| ^{superscript}    | s-=         | `org-superscript-region-or-point'   |
| \(equation\)      | s-4         | `org-latex-math-region-or-point'    |
| $inline eqn$      | C-u s-4     |                                     |
| @@latex:snippet@@ | C-u C-u 4   |                                     |
| Â°                 | s-e         | `ivy-insert-org-entity'             |

Use  `ivy-insert-org-entity' (s-e) for all accented characters.

** Block expansions in org-mode

** LaTeX
Here is a list of installed latex classes.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mapcar 'car org-latex-classes)
#+END_SRC

** new speed commands


scimax defines these new speed commands that are active when the cursor is on the first character of a headline.

| m | Mark the subtree             |
| S | widen                        |
| k | kill the subtree             |
| q | jump to a headline with avy  |
| T | org-teleport (move headline) |

The best way to see other speed commands is to put your cursor at the beginning of a headline and press ?.

** Formatted copy and paste
`ox-clip-formatted-copy' provides a way to copy org-mode with formatting so it can be pasted into other programs like MS Word and web browsers. It does this by copying the selected text to the HTML clipboard.  

* Writing
** Spell-checking

scimax is configured with flyspell and flycheck on. When you mispell a word you will see a message in the minibuffer that tells you how to fix it (C-;). Type that, and you will be able to fix the word spelling without losing your place! Spell-checking is configured with ivy, so if the word is correct, you can type M-o s to save the word in your dictionary so you will not see it again


** Track changes

Scimax provides some support for track changes and edit marks in org-mode.

[[insert:Add this text]] [[delete:Delete this]] 
 [[comment:A comment]]

The markup is clickable, and clicking on it deletes the markup.

You can use these commands
- `em-insert' - insert text at point
- `em-delete' - mark the selected text for deletion
- `em-comment' - insert a comment from minibuffer and comment history.
- `em-comment-1' - insert a comment at point with buffer editing, and multiline comments.
- `em-replace' - marks selected text for deletion, inserts new text

- `em-editmarks' - list all editmarks in an ivy selection buffer.

On an editmark you can:
- `em-accept-edit-mark-at-point'
- `em-reject-edit-mark-at-point'
- `em-delete-edit-mark-at-point' 

-`em-typo' to mark a [[typo:tpyo]]

scimax provides some commands to:
- `em-accept-all-changes'
- `em-reject-all-changes'

You can navigate the editmarks with:
- `em-next-editmark'
- `em-previous-editmark'

Note, for the next commands, you need a working wdiff command.

You can also create diffs between git commits using helm to select them.
- `em-wdiff-git'

The commands all have key bindings. The prefix key for these is H-e.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(loop for (char . func) in (cdr em-map) collect (list (char-to-string char) (format "`%s'" func)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| m | `em-comment'                   |
| w | `em-wdiff-git'                 |
| R | `em-reject-all-changes'        |
| A | `em-accept-all-changes'        |
| j | `em-reject-edit-mark-at-point' |
| a | `em-accept-edit-mark-at-point' |
| p | `em-previous-editmark'         |
| n | `em-next-editmark'             |
| o | `org-inlinetask-insert-task'   |
| r | `em-replace'                   |
| l | `em-editmarks'                 |
| k | `em-delete-editmark-at-point'  |
| d | `em-delete'                    |
| i | `em-insert'                    |
| c | `em-comment-1'                 |
| t | `em-typo'                      |


** Highlighting

Scimax provides some support for highlighting, comment overlays, and edit marks.

The main way to access the functions is via a hydra menu: `ov-highlighter/body' that is bound to H-h (hyper-h). 

The highlights are not part of org-mode, and they do not export to any backend. The highlights should work in any kind of file.

** org-ref

org-ref is the answer to citations and bibliographies in scientific writing. Run `org-ref-help' and read it.

** TODO Publishing (ox-manuscript)

The key-binding C-c C-e j should enter the ox-manuscript export menu. This process differs from the regular export process in a number of ways. It will detect if bibtex, makeindex, or  makeglossary, and if minted is used, -shell-escape will automatically be used with pdflatex. The function `ox-manuscript-latex-pdf-process' handles all of that.

Additionally, you can generate different outputs of an org-file:

- `ox-manuscript-build-submission-manuscript-and-open' :: creates a standalone tex file with embedded bibliography, and image extensions stripped, and the pdf file.

- `ox-manuscript-make-submission-archive' :: creates a directory containing all the files you normally need for submission.

- `ox-manuscript-toggle-interactive-build'

- `ox-manuscript-nobibliography'

- `ox-manuscript-texcount'

*** Manuscript templates
We have templates prepared for the following manuscripts, proposals and documents.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

- `ox-manuscript-new-ivy'
- `ox-manuscript-new-helm'

* Bibliography management
see also `org-ref'.

* Email
- `email-region' :: emails selected region
- `email-buffer' :: email the whole buffer
- `email-bibtex-entry' :: email the bibtex entry at point

These require mu4e for mail, and store properties on the headline that indicate where it was sent.

- `email-heading' :: email the current heading, including properties, deadlines, etc...
- `email-heading-body' :: email just the body of the current heading

** TODO mail merge
* Contacts
scimax provides a emacs-lisp library to interface with a contact database written in org-mode. 

First, add some org-files to the variable `contacts-files'. Any headline in these files that has an EMAIL property will be considered a contact. Then, you can search your database with `ivy-contacts' or `helm-contacts'. There are a variety of actions to choose from ranging from inserting email addresses, copying properties, opening contact urls, etc...

See `contacts-help' for more information.

* RSS feeds

It is a major challenge to keep up with the scientific literature. `elfeed' is the package we use in scimax for that. It aggregates RSS feeds and provides a pretty easy way to consume them, capture them in to org-mode, search them, and do things with them. scimax preconfigures elfeed with some python, and emacs feeds, and you can easily add new feeds:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'elfeed-feeds "http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/accacs")
#+END_SRC

or if you want entries from a feed to be automatically tagged, e.g. anything from Nature magazine could be tagged with nature:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'elfeed-feeds '("http://feeds.nature.com/nchem/rss/current" nature))
#+END_SRC


Elfeed is configured to run every half hour after Emacs is started.

On an entry you can type:
| e | email entry to someone        |
| c | capture the entry to org-mode |
| d | add bibtex entry              |

In the list of entries you can type:
| f,j | marks entry as read                                                       |
| o   | open the entry                                                            |
| b   | open browser to entry url                                                 |
| s   | start a search query (see https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed#filter-syntax) |



* Programming
** Python
- scimpy is setup with `elpy-mode'.
- `pydoc' provides nice, hyperlinked documentation for python.

** Asynchronous Python
You can run python blocks asynchronously with M-x `org-babel-async-execute:python' with the cursor in a code block. This will allow you to keep typing, and show you a buffer with the progress of your code block. When it is done, the results will be inserted into the buffer where it belongs when the job is done. A temporary hash mark will go in the results. 

** Ipython
If you like sessions in Python, the ob-ipython library is better than the default ob-python in org-mode.

Pygments doesn't support ipython out of the box for some reason, which is a problem if you want to export your src block to LaTeX. scimax fixes this for you and automatically installs this if you don't already have it.

Here is a protypical Ipython src block with a line magic.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session
%time print("hello world")
a = 6
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: hello world
: CPU times: user 32 Âµs, sys: 5 Âµs, total: 37 Âµs
: Wall time: 39.8 Âµs

And a block with cell magic.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session
%%timeit
7
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 100000000 loops, best of 3: 13.5 ns per loop
:RESULTS:
42
:END:

- `ob-ipython-inspect' seems to be broken

- `org-babel-switch-to-session' will open the IPython REPL.

M-x `ob-ipython-interrupt-kernel'
M-x `ob-ipython-kill-kernel'

*** Using other kernels - hy

Amazing. You can use other language kernels with ob-ipython.

scimax provides the jupyter-hy src block to run hylang in src blocks. The required :session and :kernel headers are automatically provided.

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-hy
(print "hello world")
(import time)
(print (time.asctime))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: hello world
: Fri Jun 10 10:21:24 2016



** Emacs-lisp
- `lispy-mode' is just amazing.

* Other Packages
** magit
Use f5 to enter `magit-status'.

** projectile

https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile for project management.

** undo-tree
There are a few undo features:
| C-/   | undo the last action          |
| C-x u | use the undo-tree (q to quit) |

** words

Try out `words-hydra/body' on a selection or word. I bound it to \\[words-hydra/body].

** ore

This command: `ore' tells you about the org-element your point is on.


* Scientific notebook
scimax provides a scientific notebook capability. Each "notebook" is actually collection of org-files in a "project". A project is the set of files in a directory that is under git version control. Each project should have a master file (the default is README.org, but you can customize `nb-master-file' to change this). The master file contains what ever you want, but typically it links to other documents in the project and provides an overview of the project.

You are basically free to structure the notebook however you want. You have all the freedom of org-mode at your fingers to document your work.

We leverage [[http://projectile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][projectile]] for project management in the notebook. We use [[https://magit.vc][magit]] for version control.

Use `nb-new' to create a new project. You will be prompted for a name, which must be a valid directory name. The directory will be created in `nb-notebook-directory'. Note that all git repos will be considered projects, so it is not necessary to use `nb-new'. It just automates a few things for you.

Use `nb-open' to open a project. This will open the project to your master file. Previously visited projects are remembered by projectile and should be shown in an ivy completion minibuffer for selection.

Probably you will keep your projects separate from your agenda files, but you still would like to see what tasks the project has? Use `nb-agenda' while in your project, and it will show you all the tasks in the org-files associated with the project.

Here are some other interesting commands
- `counsel-git-grep'
- `projectile-find-file'
- `projectile-switch-to-buffer'
- `projectile-kill-buffers'

- `ivy-org-jump-to-heading'
- `ivy-org-jump-to-heading-in-directory'
- `ivy-org-jump-to-project-headline'
- `counsel-org-tag'

You can manage the version control with magit

- `vc-next-action' will do the next logical thing for vc, e.g. add or commit.
- `vc-diff' will show you what has changed in the buffer since the last commit.
- `vc-print-log' will show you the vc log.
- `magit-status' is the portal command to see the status of the repo.

** TODO archive the notebook with git


* ivy/counsel

scimax currently uses ivy extensively for completion, and enables `ivy-mode' and `counsel-mode'. The default matching behavior is `ivy--regex-ignore-order'.

When you get an ivy minibuffer, start typing to select what you want, and when it is highlighted, press enter.

There are a couple of nuances though.

1. To eliminate matches use ! pattern, but you can only use one of these, and it comes last.

I have extended the `ivy-minibuffer-map' to enable the following:

1. M-spc will show the actions, and spc to resume the selection process.
2. C-RET to perform the action and move to the next candidate, and C-u C-RET to perform the action and move to the previous candidate.
2. M-RET will perform the default action on every candidate from the current selection to the end of the candidates. C-u M-RET does that from the current candidate to the beginning.
3. s-RET quits the selection buffer with no action.
4. ? shows you the keymap.

In the ivy selection buffer
| M-spc         | Show the actions                                           |
| spc           | resume                                                     |
| RET           | Default action and exit                                    |
| C-RET         | Default action and move to next line                       |
| C-u C-RET     | Default action and move to previous line                   |
| M-RET         | Default action on each candidate from current to end       |
| C-u M-RET     | Default action on each candidate from current to beginning |
| C-u C-u M-RET | Default action on all candidates                           |
| s-RET         | quit with no action                                        |
| ?             | show keymap help                                           |

I use Hyper-c as a prefix map for a lot of commands.

| H-c r | `ivy-resume'           |
| H-c l | `counsel-load-library' |
| H-c a | `counsel-ag'           |

** counsel-find-file
Here are some additional actions we define for `counsel-find-file'.

| a   | attach to email      |
| c   | copy relative path   |
| 4   | Open in new window   |
| 5/f | Open in new frame    |
| C   | Copy absolute path   |
| d   | open in dired        |
| D   | Delete file          |
| e   | open in external app |
| p   | insert relative path |
| P   | insert absolute path |
| l   | relative org link    |
| L   | absolute org link    |
| r   | rename file          |
* Navigation - navy

`navy' is bound to f12. It opens a hydra for navigation. The following keys are bound to commands that do something in the following senses

| j | left  |
| l | right |
| i | up    |
| k | down  |

The default mode is character mode, and you can change the mode with single characters, include a word mode (w), sentence (s), paragraph (p), page (g), line (n) and sexp (x) mode. These modes allow you navigate forward and backward by those elements. They also define binding

I have tried to make the following keys consistent:

| ; | avy-goto-char-2 |
| ' | avy-goto-line   |
| < | goto point-min  |
| > | goto point-max  |

There are some useful bindings in `navy' also.
| r | counsel-git-grep               |
| o | helm-org-agenda-files-headings |
| a | swiper-all                     |
