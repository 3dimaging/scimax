#+TITLE: Scimax

* ivy/counsel
scimax currently uses ivy extensively for completion, and enables `ivy-mode' and `counsel-mode'. The default matching behavior is `ivy--regex-ignore-order'.

When you get an ivy minibuffer, start typing to select what you want, and when it is highlighted, press enter.

There are a couple of nuances though.

1. To eliminate matches use ! pattern, but you can only use one of these, and it comes last.

I have extended the `ivy-minibuffer-map' to enable the following:

1. M-spc will show the actions, and spc to resume the selection process.
2. C-RET to perform the action and move to the next candidate, and C-u C-RET to perform the action and move to the previous candidate.
2. M-RET will perform the default action on every candidate from the current selection to the end of the candidates. C-u M-RET does that from the current candidate to the beginning.
3. s-RET quits the selection buffer with no action.
4. ? shows you the keymap.

In the ivy selection buffer
| M-spc         | Show the actions                                           |
| spc           | resume                                                     |
| RET           | Default action and exit                                    |
| C-RET         | Default action and move to next line                       |
| C-u C-RET     | Default action and move to previous line                   |
| M-RET         | Default action on each candidate from current to end       |
| C-u M-RET     | Default action on each candidate from current to beginning |
| C-u C-u M-RET | Default action on all candidates                           |
| s-RET         | quit with no action                                        |
| ?             | show keymap help                                           |

I use Hyper-c as a prefix map for a lot of commands.

| H-c r | `ivy-resume'           |
| H-c l | `counsel-load-library' |
| H-c a | `counsel-ag'           |

** counsel-find-file
Here are some additional actions we define for `counsel-find-file'.

| a   | attach to email      |
| c   | copy relative path   |
| 4   | Open in new window   |
| 5/f | Open in new frame    |
| C   | Copy absolute path   |
| d   | open in dired        |
| D   | Delete file          |
| e   | open in external app |
| p   | insert relative path |
| P   | insert absolute path |
| l   | relative org link    |
| L   | absolute org link    |
| r   | rename file          |
 
* avy 

See `hydra-avy/body' which is bound <f12>. It provides a hydra to navigate to places.

| f12 s | swiper                             |
| f12 j | avy-goto-char-2                    |
| f12 k | avy-goto-word-1                    |
| f12 l | avy-goto-line                      |
| f12 ; | avy-goto-char-in-line              |
| f12 t | avy-goto-char-timer                |
| f12 g | counsel-git-grep                   |
| f12 h | avy-goto-org-heading               |
| f12 a | jump to org heading in agenda file |

* Org-mode 

** Markup shortcuts
scimax defines some shortcuts for org-mode markup. You can select text and type the shortcut to wrap the region in the markup, or if on a word, type the shortcut to wrap the word, or type the short cut to create the markup with the cursor inside it to keep typing.

| markup            | keyshortcut | emacs-command                       |
|-------------------+-------------+-------------------------------------|
| *Bold*            | s-b         | `org-bold-region-or-point'          |
| /italics/         | s-i         | `org-italics-region-or-point'       |
| =verbatim=        | s-v         | `org-verbatim-region-or-point'      |
| ~code~            | s-c         | `org-code-region-or-point'          |
| _underline_       | s-u         | `org-underline-region-or-point'     |
| +strike+          | s-+         | `org-strikethrough-region-or-point' |
| _{subscript}      | s--         | `org-subscript-region-or-point'     |
| ^{superscript}    | s-=         | `org-superscript-region-or-point'   |
| \(equation\)      | s-4         | `org-latex-math-region-or-point'    |
| $inline eqn$      | C-u s-4     |                                     |
| @@latex:snippet@@ | C-u C-u 4   |                                     |
| Â°                 | s-e         | `ivy-insert-org-entity'            |

Use  `ivy-insert-org-entity' (s-e) for all accented characters.

** org-ref

Run `org-ref-help' and read it.

** TODO Publishing (ox-manuscript)

The key-binding C-c C-e j should enter the ox-manuscript export menu. This process differs from the regular export process in a number of ways. It will detect if bibtex, makeindex, or  makeglossary, and if minted is used, -shell-escape will automatically be used with pdflatex. The function `ox-manuscript-latex-pdf-process' handles all of that.

Additionally, you can generate different outputs of an org-file: 

- `ox-manuscript-build-submission-manuscript-and-open' :: creates a standalone tex file with embedded bibliography, and image extensions stripped, and the pdf file.

- `ox-manuscript-make-submission-archive' :: creates a directory containing all the files you normally need for submission.

- `ox-manuscript-toggle-interactive-build'

- `ox-manuscript-nobibliography'

- `ox-manuscript-texcount'

*** Manuscript templates
We have templates prepared for the following manuscripts, proposals and documents.

** new speed commands

scimax defines these new speed commands that are active when the cursor is on the first character of a headline.

| m | Mark the subtree             |
| S | widen                        |
| k | kill the subtree             |
| q | jump to a headline with avy  |
| T | org-teleport (move headline) |

The best way to see other speed commands is to put your cursor at the beginning of a headline and press ?. 

* Writing
** Spell-checking
scimax is configured with flyspell and flycheck on. When you mispell a word you will see a message in the minibuffer that tells you how to fix it (C-;). Type that, and you will be able to fix the word spelling without losing your place!

** Prose linting
scimax is configured with prose linting for org-mode (https://github.com/amperser/proselint).

You need to install proselint. This is automatically done for you by scimax.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install proselint
#+END_SRC

This will catch many issues with your prose that you probably should fix. The keybinding s-; will jump to the previous flycheck error. Back in the 1980's we did not have that. 

** Track changes
Scimax provides some support for track changes using [[https://github.com/joostkremers/criticmarkup-emacs][CriticMarkup]].

The main command to use is `cm/body' which launches a hydra menu. You can mark text for insertion, deletion, and add comment text. Scimax modifies the comment syntax
Here is some example markup:

{++Add this text++} {--Delete this--} {@a comment@} 

The markup should be clickable so you can accept/reject each change. 

You can use these commands
- `cm-addition' - insert text at point
- `cm-deletion' - mark the selected text for deletion
- `cm-comment' - insert a comment at point

To turn on track changes. Run this command again to turn it off.
- `cm-follow-changes' 

scimax provides some commands to:
- `cm-accept-all-changes'
- `cm-reject-all-changes'

Note, for the next commands, you need a working wdiff command.

You can also create diffs between git commits.
- `cm-wdiff-git'

Or between the buffer and last saved version
- `cm-wdiff-buffer-with-file'

* Email
- `email-region' :: emails selected region
- `email-buffer' :: email the whole buffer
- `email-bibtex-entry' :: email the bibtex entry at point

These require mu4e for mail, and store properties on the headline that indicate where it was sent.

- `email-heading' :: email the current heading, including properties, deadlines, etc...
- `email-heading-body' :: email just the body of the current heading

** TODO mail merge

* Programming
** Python
- elpy
- `pydoc' check it out.

** Ipython
If you like sessions in Python, the ob-ipython library is better than the default ob-python in org-mode.

Pygments doesn't support ipython out of the box for some reason, which is a problem if you want to export your src block to LaTeX. scimax fixes this for you and automatically installs this if you don't already have it.

** Emacs-lisp
- `lispy-mode' is just amazing.

* Packages
** magit
Use f5 to enter `magit-status'.

** projectile

https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile for project management.

** undo-tree
There are a few undo features:
| C-/   | undo the last action          |
| C-x u | use the undo-tree (q to quit) |

** words

Try out `words-hydra/body' on a selection or word. I bound it to \\[words-hydra/body].

** ore

This command: `ore' tells you about the org-element your point is on.

* Scientific notebook
scimax provides a scientific notebook capability. 

Each "notebook" is actually collection of org-files in a "project".

A project is the set of files in a directory that is under git version control. Each project should have a master file (the default is README.org, but you can customize `nb-master-file' to change this). The master file contains what ever you want, but typically it links to other documents in the project and provides an overview of the project.

You are basically free to structure the notebook however you want. You have all the freedom of org-mode at your fingers to document your work.

We leverage [[http://projectile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][projectile]] for project management in the notebook. We use [[https://magit.vc][magit]] for version control.

Use `nb-new' to create a new project. You will be prompted for a name, which must be a valid directory name. The directory will be created in `nb-notebook-directory'. Note that all git repos will be considered projects, so it is not necessary to use `nb-new'. It just automates a few things for you.

Use `nb-open' to open a project. This will open the project to your master file. Previously visited projects are remembered by projectile and should be shown in an ivy completion minibuffer for selection. 

Probably you will keep your projects separate from your agenda files, but you still would like to see what tasks the project has? Use `nb-agenda' while in your project, and it will show you all the tasks in the org-files associated with the project.

Here are some other interesting commands 
- `counsel-git-grep'
- `projectile-find-file'
- `projectile-switch-to-buffer'
- `projectile-kill-buffers'

- `ivy-org-jump-to-heading' 
- `ivy-org-jump-to-heading-in-directory'
- `ivy-org-jump-to-project-headline'
- `counsel-org-tag'

You can manage the version control with magit

- `vc-next-action' will do the next logical thing for vc, e.g. add or commit.
- `vc-diff' will show you what has changed in the buffer since the last commit.
- `vc-print-log' will show you the vc log.
- `magit-status' is the portal command to see the status of the repo.

** TODO archive the notebook with git
